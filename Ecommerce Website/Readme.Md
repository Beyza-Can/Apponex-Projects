Project 1: Interactive E-commerce Product Gallery
Objective: Develop an interactive product gallery for an e-commerce platform that allows users to filter products by categories, price range, and ratings.
Requirements:
    • Use JavaScript, React.js, and CSS for the frontend development. (I did that part.)

    • Implement interactive elements like sliders for price range and star ratings for reviews.(I did that too.)
